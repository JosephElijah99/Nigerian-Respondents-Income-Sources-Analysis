# Nigerian-Respondents-Income-Sources-Analysis
This repository contains an analysis of income sources among Nigerian respondents, based on a questionnaire. The analysis covers data cleaning, insights generation, and visualization to understand the diversity and distribution of income sources among the population surveyed.

Project Overview
The primary goal of this analysis is to explore the variety and frequency of income sources reported by Nigerian respondents. The dataset is cleaned, structured, and analyzed to provide clear insights and recommendations based on the patterns observed.

Dataset Information
The dataset consists of multiple responses from Nigerian individuals, capturing:

Respondent ID: Unique identifier for each respondent.
Income Sources: Information on various income sources (e.g., salary, business, investments, remittances).
Other Demographic Variables: Age, gender, location, etc.
The data has been collected through a questionnaire, and the analysis adheres to the structure and instructions provided.

Analysis Steps
Data Cleaning:

Missing or inconsistent entries were identified and handled appropriately.
Duplicate entries were checked to ensure the uniqueness of respondents.
Standardized values across multiple-choice questions for consistency.
Calculating Number of Income Sources per Respondent:

Derived the total number of income sources for each respondent using logical functions and aggregation methods.
Finding Maximum and Minimum Number of Income Sources:

Determined the maximum and minimum number of income sources reported by any respondent in the dataset.
Visualizing Distribution of Income Sources:

Created a clustered column chart to visualize the distribution of the number of income sources per respondent.
Distribution of Respondents by Income Source:

Employed wildcard characters and functions like VLOOKUP to categorize and count respondents based on each specific income source.
Key Insights
Income Diversity: The majority of respondents reported having multiple income sources, with a significant portion relying on traditional income forms like salary or business.
Outliers: A small number of respondents reported a very high number of income sources, indicating diverse income-generating activities.
Frequency of Income Sources: Income sources such as salary, business, and remittances were among the most common.
Recommendations
Economic Empowerment Programs:

Develop programs to support individuals with fewer income sources, providing them with skills and resources to diversify their income.
Focus on Business Development:

Given the high number of respondents earning from businesses, support entrepreneurship through grants, training, and mentorship.
Enhance Financial Literacy:

Implement initiatives that educate respondents about investment opportunities and savings, increasing income diversity and financial stability.
